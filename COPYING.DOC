BiopTools is a set of small programs which use the BiopLib library.
Many of these tools act as filters taking PDB format as input and
generating PDB format as output. All programs that take only a PDB
file as input have names that start with 'pdb'.


BiopTools is licensed under the Gnu Public Licence Version 3.
